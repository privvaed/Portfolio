            <h3>Charles Adrian B. Flores</h3>
            <p>Hey there, I'm <strong>Charles Adrian B. Flores</strong>, an <em>18-year-old</em> senior high school at <em>Filamer Christian University</em> with a zest for life and a camera in hand. Photography isn't just a hobby for me; it's a way to freeze moments in time and share stories through vibrant images.</p>

            <p>My sights are set on a career as a <em>Civil Engineer or Software Developer/Engineer,</em> where I can blend creativity with technical prowess to make a real impact. Gaming is my escape, with <em>Mobile Legends and Genshin Impact</em> being my go-to worlds for adventure and strategy. And while I may not be the star athlete, I find joy and challenge in the intellectual game of <em>Chess</em>, where every move counts.</p>

            <p>In a nutshell, I am an 18-year-old photography enthusiast born on Nov 13, 2005, currently studying at Filamer Christian University. My goal is to pursue Civil Engineering at Capiz State University, combining my passion for photography, love for gaming, and aspirations for a successful career in engineering into a promising future.</p>
